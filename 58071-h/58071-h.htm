<h2><a name="page3"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 3</span><i>TO
THE PUBLIC</i>.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">At</span> the particular request of
gentlemen of the first rate talent, and who rank high in the
scientific world, it is, that the author of the following letter
is induced to lay it before the public generally, but more
particularly his medical brethren; in the hope that some one or
other, may be more fortunate in reducing the object of it beyond
a possibility of doubt.&nbsp; It may be said, and with truth,
that publications are too frequently the vehicles of
self-adulation, and <a name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
4</span>as such, suffer greatly from the lash of severe
criticism; but the author begs to assure his readers, that his
views are totally different, merely considering it a duty
incumbent on him, (as a medical practitioner, and servant to the
public), to make known any thing which has not been tried, and
which ultimately may add something towards the relief of human
suffering, arising from acute disease.&nbsp; The only method of
obtaining this end, is, in the author&rsquo;s opinion, candid
discussion, and liberality of sentiment, which, too commonly is a
deficient ingredient in the welfare of so important a profession,
productive of serious consequences, not only to the parties
themselves, but to the patient whose life is entrusted to their
care.&nbsp; The duty and object, however, of the Physician and
Surgeon, is generally considered to be the relief of a
fellow-creature, by applying certain remedies to the cure of
internal affections, or cutting some portion of the body, whereby
parts are severed from each other altogether, or relieving
cavities of the aggravating cause of disease.&nbsp; There is not
an individual, he believes, <a name="page5"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 5</span>who does not shudder at the idea of an
operation, however skilful the Surgeon, or urgent the case,
knowing the great pain that must necessarily be endured; and it
is frequently lamented by the operator himself, that something
has not been done to tranquilize fear, and diminish the agony of
the patient.&nbsp; With this view of the subject then, it is,
that he submits his observations and experiments to the public in
the brief form of a letter to a private gentleman of the highest
talent as a man of science, who with others, thought them worthy
to be laid before the Royal Society; and if one grain of
knowledge can be added to the general fund, to obtain a means for
the relief of pain, the labours of the author will be amply
rewarded.</p>
<h2><a name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 7</span>A
LETTER, &amp;c.</h2>
<p><i>Sir</i>,</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> facility of suspending
animation, by carbonic acid gas, and other means, without
permanent injury to the subject, having been long known, it
appears to me rather singular that no experiments have hitherto
been made with the object of ascertaining whether operations
could be successfully performed upon animals whilst in a torpid
state; and whether wounds inflicted upon them in such a state
would be found to heal with greater or less facility than similar
wounds inflicted on the same animals <a name="page8"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 8</span>whilst in possession of all their
powers of feeling and suffering.&nbsp; Several circumstances led
me to suspect that wounds made on animals whilst in a torpid
state, would be found, in many cases, to heal most readily; and
the results of some experiments which I have made, lead me to
think that these conjectures are well founded, and to hope that
you will think the results sufficiently interesting to induce you
to do me the honor to lay them before the Royal Society.&nbsp;
The experiments were necessarily made upon living animals, but
they were confined to animals previously condemned to death; and
as their lives were preserved, and their suffering very slight,
(certainly not so great as they would have sustained if their
lives had been taken away by any of the ordinary methods of
killing such animals) I venture to hope that they, in the
aggregate, rather received benefit than injury.&nbsp; Subjects of
different species were employed, chiefly puppies of a few weeks
or months old, and the experiments were often repeated, but as
the results were all uniform, and as my chief object is to
attract the attention of other medical men to <a
name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 9</span>the subject, I
wish to do little more than state the general results.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Experiment</span> 1st.&nbsp; Dogs of about
a month old were placed under a glass cover, surrounded by water,
so as to prevent the ingress of atmospheric air, where their
respiration in a short time ceased, and a part of one ear of each
was then taken off; there was no hemorrhage, and the wounds were
healed at the end of the third day, without any inflammation
having taken place, or the Animals having apparently suffered any
pain or inconvenience from the operation.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Experiment</span> 2d.&nbsp; After the same
animals had fully recovered their powers of feeling, a similar
part of the other ear of each was taken off; a good deal of blood
now flowed from the wounds, and some degree of inflammation
followed, and the wounds did not heal till the fifth day.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Experiment</span> 3d.&nbsp; An experiment
was made similar to No. 1, in every respect, except that the
suspension of animation was <a name="page10"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 10</span>much more suddenly brought on by the
agency of sulphuric acid and carbonate of Lime.&nbsp; The results
in this case were not so satisfactory; some blood escaped from
the wounds, and a slight degree of inflammation followed, and the
wounds did not heal so rapidly as the first experiment.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Experiment</span> 4th.&nbsp; Mice, having
been confined in a glass tube of a foot long, were rendered
insensible by carbonic acid gas slowly introduced in small
quantities, and one foot from each was taken off; no hemorrhage
took place upon the return of sensation, and the wounds appeared
quite healed on the third day, without the animals having
apparently suffered pain, when they were given their liberty.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Experiment</span> 5th.&nbsp; An adult dog
was rendered insensible by means similar to the preceding, and
the muscles and blood-vessels of one of its legs were
divided.&nbsp; There was no hemorrhage from the smaller vessels;
a ligature which secured the main artery came away on the fourth
day, and the animal <a name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
11</span>recovered without having at any period shewn any
material symptom of uneasiness.&nbsp; In this experiment
animation was suspended during seventeen minutes, allowing
respiration occasionally to intervene by means of inflating
instruments.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Experiment</span> 6th.&nbsp; A dog was
rendered insensible by the means employed in experiment first,
and an incision was made through the muscles of the loin, through
which a ligature was passed, and made tight; no appearance
whatever of suffering occurred upon the return of animation, nor
till the following day, when inflammation came on with subsequent
suppuration.&nbsp; The ligature came away on the seventh day, and
on the twelfth the wound was healed.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>As the recital of such experiments as those preceding must be
as little agreeable to you, as the repetition of them has been to
myself, I shall not give a detail of any others, but shall only
state the opinions which the aggregate results have led me to
entertain.&nbsp; I feel perfectly satisfied that any <a
name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 12</span>surgical
operation might be performed with quite as much safety upon a
subject in an insensible state, as in a sensible state, and that
a patient might be kept with perfect safety long enough in an
insensible state, for the performance of the most tedious
operation.&nbsp; My own experience has also satisfied me that in
very many cases the best effects would be produced by the
patient&rsquo;s mind being relieved from the anticipation of
suffering, and his body from the actual suffering of a severe
operation; and I believe that there are few, if any Surgeons, who
could not operate more skillfully when they were conscious they
were not inflicting pain.&nbsp; There are also many cases in
which it would be important to prevent any considerable
hemorrhage, and in which the surgeon would feel the advantages of
a diminished flow of blood during an operation.&nbsp; I have
reason to believe that no injurious consequence would follow if
the necessity of the case should call for more than once
suspension of animation; for a young growing dog was several
times rendered insensible by carbonic acid gas, with intervals of
about <a name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
13</span>twenty-four or forty-eight hours, without sustaining,
apparently, the slightest injury.&nbsp; Its appetite continued
perfectly good, and I ascertained, by weighing it, that it gained
weight rapidly.&nbsp; I am not, at present, aware of any source
of danger to a patient, from an operation performed during a
state of insensibility, which would not operate to the same
extent upon a patient in full possession of his powers of
suffering, particularly if he were rendered insensible by being
simply subjected to respire confined air.&nbsp; I used inflating
instruments in one experiment only, and therefore am not prepared
to say to what extent such may be used with advantage; but I
think it probable that those and the Galvanic fluid would operate
in restoring animation in some cases.&nbsp; I was prepared to
employ the Galvanic fluid if any case had occurred to render the
operation of any stimulant necessary, but all the subjects
recovered by being simply exposed to the open air; and I feel so
confident that animation in the human subject could be safely
suspended by proper means, carefully employed, that, (although I
could not conscientiously <a name="page14"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 14</span>recommend a patient to risk his life
in the experiment,) I certainly should not hesitate a moment to
become the subject of it, if I were under the necessity of
suffering any long or severe operation,</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
